## About Project

This project was what we've beuilt for our Lighthouse Labs challenge. It is a two sided portal for users looking to order pickup foods from nearby restaurants and a restaurant side where the restaurants can manage incoming orders.

As a client you're able to create account/login, browse and select restaurants, order foods from the restaurant menus(icluding modifications, allergies and etc.). 

Once the order is placed, the restaurant receives a text notification, and then they can either accept or reject the food order and indicating how long the order will take.

The user then gets a text message confirming that the order has been placed and the estimated time for the order.

Both the restaurant and user can review their order history and see past orders.

## Tech Stack

We've built this project using NodeJS, EJS templating, Semantic-UI for design elements and PostgreSQL as our database. We've also used Google Maps and Twilio messanging API's.
